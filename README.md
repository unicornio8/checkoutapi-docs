Atlas Docs
------------

In this repository you will find the documentation of team Atlas' (aka Distributed Commerce) components.

Those components are meant to provide to our partners a more streamlined access the Zalando shopping platform to enable our customers to purchase wherever they are.

The information displayed here is directed at clients of our components, hopefully clarifying any doubts about how to use our APIs.

Should there be something still unclear feel free to reach out to us via an issue in this repository, or via email to team-atlas@zalando.de

Documentation is written with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate)

Getting Started with Slate
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

(Taken, and slightly altered, from Slate's instructions)

1. `cd checkoutapi-docs`
2. Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Docker).
